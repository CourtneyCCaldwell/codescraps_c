# codescraps_c
Some scrap code in C; just building little functions, either as examples for others, or small exercises fcluor myself.


Sometimes I just want to fiddle around, making little programs that accomplish simple things, just to see how to do it.

Other times, I'm explaining a concept to someone else, and in the process, need to make a program to demonstrate.

Either way, if they're not part of a larger project I'm working on, they'll end up right here!

Below is a description of the programs included: I'll update as I go.

~fizzbuzz.c
  After seeing some info online and some videos on how this is sometimes used (perhaps in the UK more than not)
  as an interview question, I decided to see how I would implement it. I've become very quick at building a program
  to play fizzbuzz, and I've done it a few ways, this is just one of the methods I've tried.
